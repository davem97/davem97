    <h1>FAQ</h1><br>
    <p>Disclaimer: This asset is intended to strictly be a First Person character controller (which means 3D) 
      and as a result, all features and aspects of this project have been designed and coded with 
      that in mind. Minimal testing has been done to verify whether all aspects of this asset 
      support 2D physics and movement, however nothing has actively been done to prevent this asset
      from usage of either of the two.</p>

      <h2>What is your "First Person" character controller?</h2>
      This character controller is a first-person based character which uses a capsule as the default player 
character and also uses the in-built character controller as well as a script that goes along with it 
which expands on that much more and handles all of the character requirements.</p>

<h2>Is there Third Person available?</h2><br> 
Currently there is no third-person view/movement available on this asset as it is aimed at being a 
first-person project first.</p>

<h2>What type of games is this asset aimed at producing?</h2><br> 
The main design focus was to turn this into a fast-paced, arcadey
first-person shooter game. But this asset can be used to create any type of game,
such as a horror game, survival game, RTS game (with some custom adjustments) and so on.</p>

<h2>How is collision handled?</h2><br> 
The character controller can collide with other controllers and the enviroment including other colliders 
and has very basic interactions with Rigidbodies. The asset was created with more of a "sandbox" shooter 
feel, so essentially collision works at a standard level but in its current state, the character controller
cannot push around objects that contain a Rigidbody, and Rigidbody objects cannot push around the controller
with proper physics and mechanics.</p>

<h2>How do you handle the camera?</h2><br> 
There are 2 different cameras that are used, with one specifically intended for movements with the character 
itself, and the other which deals with anything attached to the player (hands, arms, weapons, or other objects), 
and contain different settings for rendering, etc.</p>

<h2>Can a humanoid character be used in place of the default capsule?</h2><br> 
Yes, there is no reason that a humanoid character would not work in place of the default capsule that this asset
comes with. Nothing has been implemented to tie this asset to a capsule character, but you will need to
make some custom adjustments to get your humanoid character to function as you would like.</p>
